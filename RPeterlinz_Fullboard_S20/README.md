# Full Board

[Full Board](http://www.addictinggames.com/puzzle-games/fullboard.jsp) is an interactive one-person puzzle/game by LightForce played on a rectangular grid.

The game starts with a board of M rows by N columns with some grid squares marked as “obstacles” (drawn as black dots).  The player chooses a starting position to place a ball (marked “S” in the figure to the right) and chooses a direction to advance (left, right, up, or down).  Once a direction is chosen, the ball will advance in that direction until it hits an obstacle, the boundary of the game board, or a square that the ball has already been through.  The player then chooses another direction, and the ball will advance in the same manner. The game ends when no legal move can be made.  The player wins if and only if the ball has traveled through all the empty grid squares on the board.
